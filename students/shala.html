      Hello! I'm Ari Shala, a computer science student at City College, University of York. I have a strong interest in paleontology and web development. For the DinoPedia project, I was responsible for researching various dinosaur species and creating engaging content to educate and captivate our audience.
            Paleoentology isn't my only interest; I also enjoy activity like hiking, gyming, races. In addition, I love art and everything surrounding it. Photography is another major interest of mine.
